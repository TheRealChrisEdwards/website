                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;line-height: 160%;">For my first project on CodePen, I'm designing my tribute page to recognize Rick Rubin, who is a legendary American record producer &amp; music industry mogul.  His music production methods are incredibly diverse, yet his superior knowledge of recording &amp; production techniques allows him to connect artists/singers with perfect, complementary sounds.  Rick Rubin's experience in the music industry is unparalleled, leading many of the world's most popular musicians to  collaborate with him.  These collaborations have led to some of the most critically-acclaimed albums of all time being created.  In an industry full of flamboyant, power-hungry executives, Rubin's nonchalant presence &amp; composed personality makes him a mysteriously intriguing figure.  While his career is full of significant awards &amp; achievements, this tribute page wishes to recognize the amazing music Rick Rubin has created, and the historic impact he's had on popular culture.</p>
