# freeCodeCamp Project: Tribute Page

This webpage is an introductory project for [freeCodeCamp (FCC)](http://www.freecodecamp.com). FCC is a free, online coding bootcamp designed to teach students web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, node.js & MongoDB, to name a few. This Tribute Page project consists of building a single, static webpage that introduces the viewer to a specific person. The instructions are simple: to incorporate a picture of the specific person, and a hyperlink that connects the viewer to their Wikipedia page. The webpage must also be "functionally similar" to the freeCodeCamp example, which incorporates responsive design methods. I've chosen my tribute to be about the music producer, [Rick Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin). Feel free to explore my Tribute Page and email any comments to me [@TheRealChrisEdwards](mailto: TheRealChrisEdwards@outlook.com). Thanks!
